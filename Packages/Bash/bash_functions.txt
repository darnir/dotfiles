bash_functions - Reference Manual for Bash Functions

SYNOPSIS
--------
*bash_functions*: List and description of custom functions in '~/.bash_functions'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page is a listing for the various custom defined functions in
'~/.bash_functions'

WARNING: The functions defined here are niche utility methods written for a specific
purpose and often do not have error checking included. User discretion is
advised when using these functions.

The '~/.bash_functions' file will define the following function prototypes:

FUNCTIONS
---------

*pastebin*::
Expects a data stream via standard input which is sent to an online
pastebin-like service. Currently, this function will send the ASCII, plaintext
data to _http://ix.io_ for sharing. The link to the shared data is then output
to 'stdout'. Example:
[source,sh]
-----------
$ cat file.txt | pastebin
http://ix.io/ek9
------------

*tre* '[path]'::
_`tre`_ is a shorthand for _`tree`_ with hidden files and color enabled, ignoring
the '.git' directory, listing directories first. The output gets piped into
_`less`_ with options to preserve color and line numbers, unless the output is
small enough for one screen.

*cov-make*::
A special utility function. *cov-make* is used to generate and submit a
_coverity_ build package for static analysis. Currently this function has been
hardcoded to build and submit a package for *GNU Wget* only from a specific
location on the disk. In the future this function may be expanded to be more
generic. The Coverity API Token is required for this function to complete and
the function will fail if the *bash_secrets* file with the API Token hasn't been
sourced yet.

IMPORTANT: *cov-make* will only execute from '~/Programming/wget/' directory and
requires the *`$COV_TOKEN`* variable to be set with the correct API Token for
coverity.

*calc* '[expr]'::
This is a simple command line calculator for Bash. It uses bc to compute
various results. Give it a valid bc expression and this function will try to
evaluate its value. Complex output may cause problems on the printf statement.

*pdflatex* '[file]'::
This function invokes the similarly named /usr/bin/pdflatex binary and uses
grep to colour the output and highlight the errors and warnings when running
pdflatex.

*man* '[page]'::
Similar to pdflatex, this function is invoked when someone tries to load a man
page. It adds some amount of syntax colouring to the man page to make it
easier to scan visually.

*resolve* '[file]'::
Expects a filename as a parameter at $1. +
A file named $1.pacnew should also exist. This function will then invoke
vimdiff to diff the files for resolving the conflicts.
This is a very crude function with little to no error checking and should be
invoked with care.

*extract* '[compressed file]'::
Expects a compressed file as a paramter +
This is a utility function I copied from the Arch Wiki. This function accepts
a filename as a parameter and based on the filename it will run the respective
utility to decompress the file. The way this function is written, it can be
used even with older versions of tar which do not have filename based
detection of the algorithm.

*pack* '[filename]' '[file(s)]'::
Expects a filename with a valid extension as the first paramter. All other
parameters list the files that need to be included in the compressed file.
This function is the dual of the above extract() function. Given a filename,
it recognizes the type and creates the respective compressed file containing
all the files provided on the command line.

*note* '[options || notes]'::
Another simple but extremely useful utlity function. This was copied from the
ArchWiki too. Expects a bunch of text as its parameters which is then stored
in ~/.notes file.

[source,txt]
-----------
Commands:
Add a new note:  $ note <Enter note here>
Display notes:   $ note
Clean all notes: $ note -c
-----------

*pdf* '[-o]' '[file]'::
Expects a pdf file as an argument. +
This is a simple helper function to asynchronously launch a pdf viewer (evince) from
the command line without polluting it. If the "-o" switch is passed, then Okular
will be used as the PDF viewer.

*pdftools* '[action]'::
Simple common operations to perform on a (set of) PDF file(s) +

[source,txt]
------------
Actions:
  compress:  Compress a PDF to reduce quality and space
  join:      Join multiple PDF files into a single file
------------

*timer* '[time]' '[message]'::
Usage: timer [time] [message] +
This function takes a time argument that is acceptable to sleep(1) and a
message. After a period of [time], the message is displayed on the screen and
a audio beep is generated. For the beep to be played, ensure that the beep
channel in ALSA is not muted.

*screen* '[template]'::
Usage: screen [preset]
This function overrides the call to /usr/bin/screen. There exist a number of
screen presets in $HOME. When $1 to this function matches an existing preset,
this function invokes screen with the respective screenrc file. As a result it
can be used to quickly set up a development environment for multiple projects.

*ssh-genkey* '[name]'::
Creates a new SSH key
