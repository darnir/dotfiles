# SYNOPSIS
#	mutt_netscape file
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Mutt invokes external attachment viewers by writing the
#	attachment to a temporary file, executing the pipeline specified
#	for that attachment type in the mailcap file, waiting for the
#	pipeline to terminate, writing nulls over the temporary file,
#	then deleting it.  This causes problems when using netscape to
#	view HTML attachments.
#
#	If netscape is executed in the foreground, the mutt user
#	interface is hung until netscape exits, so the user can't do
#	anything else with mutt until he or she finishes reading the
#	attachment and exits netscape.
#
#	If netscape is executed in the background, it must be given
#	enough time to completely read the file before returning control
#	to mutt, since mutt will then obliterate the file.
#
#	The solution provided here is to invoke netscape from this
#	script after first copying mutt's temporary file to another
#	temporary file.  This script can then quickly return control to
#	mutt while netscape can take as much time as it needs to read
#	and render the attachment.
#
# EXAMPLE
#	To use netscape to view HTML attachments from mutt, add the
#	following line to mutt's mailcap file.
#
#	text/html;	mutt_netscape %s
#
# BUGS
#	This script does not rm the the "temporary" file created in
#	/tmp, so the user should clean these out periodically.	Because
#	most users have netscape running all the time, and because the
#	/opt/spk/inv/netscape invocatable executes netscape in the
#	background, this script cannot determine when netscape and/or
#	the user is done with a file.
